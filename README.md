# Reddit Saved Images Downloader 0.01
This is a Python3 script that downloads all saved image links given a Reddit account.

It works just enough but not well.

## Some issues:
* URLs are accessed without a user-agent
* Account information is plain-text
* No comments
* No options
* Does not support Imgur albums

## Some features:
* Downloads .jpg, .png, .gif, .webm, .mp4
* Supports gfycat links, non-album Imgur links, and generic image links
